Task Management Application
Requirements:
Task Interface:
Create a TypeScript interface Task with the following properties:
id (string or number)
title (string)
description (string)
completed (boolean)
Task List Component:
Create a TaskList component that takes an array of tasks as props and displays them.
Each task should show its title, description, and a checkbox to mark it as completed.
Implement a feature to toggle the completion status when the checkbox is clicked.
Task Form Component:
Create a TaskForm component with a form to add new tasks.
The form should have input fields for the task title, description, and a submit button.
When a new task is submitted, add it to the task list.
Task App Component:
Create an App component that integrates the TaskList and TaskForm.
Manage the list of tasks and their state at the App level.
Data Flow:
Ensure proper data flow between components using props and state.
Utilize TypeScript to define and enforce the types of props and state.
Styling (Optional):
You can add some basic styling to make the application visually appealing using CSS or a styling library
like styled-components.
TypeScript Tips:
Use TypeScript interfaces to define the types for props and state in each component.
Leverage generics for reusable components or functions.
Ensure that your components are type-safe, and the TypeScript compiler helps catch potential errors.
