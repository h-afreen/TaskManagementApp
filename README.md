Task Management Application Readme
This repository contains a Task Management Application built using React and TypeScript. The application consists of several components that work together to manage tasks efficiently.

Components
Task Interface
The Task interface is defined in TypeScript with the following properties:

id (string or number)
title (string)
description (string)
completed (boolean)
This interface is used to ensure type safety when dealing with tasks throughout the application.

TaskList Component
The TaskList component takes an array of tasks as props and displays them. Each task is represented with its title, description, and a checkbox to mark it as completed. The component implements a feature to toggle the completion status when the checkbox is clicked.

TaskForm Component
The TaskForm component includes a form to add new tasks. It consists of input fields for the task title, description, and a submit button. When a new task is submitted, it is added to the task list.

Task App Component
The App component serves as the main component that integrates the TaskList and TaskForm. It manages the list of tasks and their state at the App level, ensuring proper data flow between components using props and state.

TypeScript Implementation
Throughout the application, TypeScript is leveraged to define and enforce the types of props and state. Interfaces are used to define the types for props and state in each component, ensuring type safety and allowing the TypeScript compiler to catch potential errors.

Generics are employed for reusable components or functions, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

Styling (Optional)
Styling is optional but can be added to make the application visually appealing. You have the flexibility to use CSS or styling libraries like styled-components to enhance the user interface.
